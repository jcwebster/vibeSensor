## Welcome!

The purpose of this project will be to determine what the vibrational damping effects of different longboard wheels are.

I began this project after moving to Germany and having some bumpy rides over cobblestones on my Landyachtz Dinghy. I realized the value of having a device that could be used to measure the intensity of vibrations felt by the rider of a longboard with different wheel set ups for the electric longboarding industry or people generally interested in a smooth, cruisy ride.

My goal is to have a simply operated measurement device that will be attached to a board, where the user just has to turn it on and push a button to start measuring, and then have a resultant reading output at the end of a standard measurement period.

This will allow the user to ride the board with different sets of wheels over different terrains and have readings output each time for comparison. I hope to test wheels such as [Shark Wheels](https://sharkwheel.com/70mm-78a-smoke-black-sidewinder-longboard-wheels/), [ABEC-11](http://www.abec11.com/products/abec11/abec-11-107mm-electric-flywheels-74a-77a), and some [Hawgs](http://www.hawgswheels.com/fatty/) that I already own.

I currently have an STM32 L475 Discovery board I plan to use the accelerometer on, and program it in C. I'll use a couple of simple switches/buttons for power and start, an old rechargeable mobile battery pack or lithium ion battery for power, and design a 3D printed casing with a mounting system. Stay tuned!
